# Project about data structures using linked list and hash table 

## 1. Hospital Triage System
This project simulates a **patient queue** using a simple linked list, prioritizing patients with a **Yellow card (A)** (more urgent) over those with a **Green card (V)** (less urgent).

- **Yellow card (A)**: higher priority, numbering starts at 201  
- **Green card (V)**: lower priority, numbering starts at 1  
- Interactive menu to add patients, view the queue, and call the next patient
